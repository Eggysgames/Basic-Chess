=== Basic Chess === 

This chessboard Github combines 2 popular chess repositories to make a workable chess engine with UI vs random moves as a test to get a working game operational in the fastest way possible to have a working template to use.

It uses React-Chessboard for the UI - https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chessboard

It uses Chess.JS for the engine - https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.j

=== Custom Changes === 

- Added popup alerts for Checkmate and Draw
- Made TSX version
